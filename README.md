# market_sim
a simple market, written in fortran, that seeks to interactively let people buy and sell on a simulated pure energy market

This is meant as a simple test, exploring the idea of bypassing the idea of markets as commodities or services emporiums. 
Instead,it is the purpose to see a market for what it actually is; a repository of energy that is socially accesable.
Ultimately, everything that we consider that has worth or is worthwhile is actually some form of energy conversion,
as energy is used to change CO2 and H2O into glucose, starch and protiens for food, or from Aluminium and steel to cars
or from food to chemical energy that allows a tradesman to complete their work. Energy is what we are all actually trading in.
It is time to start modelling a market in this way.

This is still a simple program. Compiling and executing simply puts the user into a simple simulated market that they can buy
and sell into, using the prompts and information provided on printout. It still needs a lot of work as it only has a simple
matrix/random action structure. I intend to enact concepts from physics, such as brownian motion and thermodynamic laws in order
to test if these laws have som applicaple form in the world of economics.
